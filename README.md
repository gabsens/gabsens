I am a first-year PhD student at [CREST - ENSAE](http://crest.science), advised by [Victor-Emmanuel Brunel](https://vebrunel.com/about/).

My interests include:
- Statistics in nonlinear spaces
- High-dimensional Regression
- Optimal Transport

I studied at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) and ENS Paris-Saclay, got a master's degree from the latter ([MVA](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/formation/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-vision-learning)).

My Github repositories are the products of coursework and of various projects (related to steganography, low-level memory manipulation, scrapping, ...)

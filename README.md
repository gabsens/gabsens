I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Mathematics](http://wwwen.uni.lu/research/fstm/dmath) at the [University of Luxembourg](http://wwwen.uni.lu/), working with [Yannick Baraud](https://math.uni.lu/baraud/Home.html).

I defended my PhD thesis on December 15, 2023. My manuscript is available [here](https://gabsens.github.io/files/manuscript.pdf).

My interests include:
- Bayesian Nonparametrics
- Statistics in metric spaces
- Statistics in infinite-dimensional normed spaces
- High-dimensional Regression

I studied at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) and ENS Paris-Saclay, got a master's degree from the latter ([MVA](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/formation/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-vision-learning)).

My Github repositories are the products of coursework and various projects (related to steganography, low-level memory manipulation, scrapping, ...)

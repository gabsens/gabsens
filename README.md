I am a third-year PhD student at [CREST - ENSAE](http://crest.science), advised by Victor-Emmanuel Brunel.  

**News**: I defended my PhD thesis on December 15, 2023. My manuscript is available [here](https://gabsens.github.io/files/manuscript.pdf).

My interests include:
- Statistics in metric spaces
- Statistics in infinite-dimensional normed spaces
- High-dimensional Regression

I studied at [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/en/) and ENS Paris-Saclay, got a master's degree from the latter ([MVA](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/formation/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-mathematics-vision-learning)).

My Github repositories are the products of coursework and various projects (related to steganography, low-level memory manipulation, scrapping, ...)
